# ML-and-Deep-Learning-Notebooks

This repository contains a collection of notebooks that were proposed as part of my *Mathematical Foundations of Machine Learning* course at Imperial College London.  
I have completed and adapted these notebooks to reinforce my understanding of core machine learning and deep learning concepts.  
They illustrate the models, techniques, and optimisation methods that I currently master.

The notebooks cover a range of topics, from classical neural network architectures to modern transformer-based models and optimisation methods.
